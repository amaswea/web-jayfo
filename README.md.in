# Website for James Fogarty
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fogies/web-jayfo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fogies/web-jayfo)

The website for James Fogarty, as hosted at <http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/>.

# Building the Site

This site is implemented in Jekyll, which requires Ruby and Node.js. It also uses Python for automation and testing.

## Installing Python

Development currently requires:

{% include "base/readme/ruby_install.md" %}

{% include "base/readme/node_install.md" %}

{% include "base/readme/python_install.md" %}

{% include "base/readme/python_venv_create.md" %}

## Building and Serving the Site

Invoke automation is provided for building the site.

If it is not already active, you need to re-activate the virtual environment.
From the working directory of our project (e.g., `{{ readme.working_directory }}`):

    {{ python_version_params.virtual_environment_name }}\Scripts\activate.bat

To build the site:

    invoke build_test

To build and serve the site on `localhost:4000`, continuously updating based on changes:

    invoke serve_test
