    <h1>Organizers</h1>        
        <h2>James Fogarty</h2>
        <p><b>Computer Science & Engineering<br />DUB Group<br />University of Washington</b></p>
        <p>James Fogarty is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. His broad research interests are in Human Computer Interaction, User Interface Software and Technology, and Ubiquitous Computing. His research focuses on developing, deploying, and evaluating new human-centered approaches to the obstacles surrounding widespread adoption of intelligent and ubiquitous computing technologies. James received his PhD in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
        
        <h2>Eric Horvitz</h2>
        <p><b>Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group<br />Microsoft Research</b></p>
        <p>Eric Horvitz is a Principal Researcher and Research Area Manager at Microsoft Research. His interests span challenges in machine reasoning and learning, search and information retrieval, and human-computer interaction. He has been elected a Fellow and Councilor of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and is now serving as the President of the organization. He has served as Chair of the Association for Uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence (AUAI), on the DARPA Information Science and Technology Study Group (ISAT), and on the Naval Research Advisory Committee (NRAC). He received his Ph.D. and M.D. degrees at Stanford University.</p>
        
        <h2>Ashish Kapoor</h2>
        <p><b>Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group<br />Microsoft Research</b></p>
        <p>Ashish Kapoor is a Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond and holds a Ph.D. from M.I.T. Media Laboratory. His research interests are centered around interactive machine learning and computer vision with applications in user modeling and human-computer interaction scenarios. His current research is focused on systems that often involve humans in the loop and have the ability to adapt and learn over long periods of time. Ashish was a part of organizing committee for COMSWARE 2007 and is also serving as a publicity chair for the International Symposium on Location and Context Awareness (LOCA 2009). He is also co-organizing AAAI 2009 spring symposium on Human Behavior Modeling and has been part of various program committees in the areas of machine learning and human computer interaction.</p>
        
        <h2>Desney Tan</h2>
        <p><b>Computational User Experiences Group<br />Microsoft Research</b></p>
        <p>Desney Tan is a Researcher in the Visualization and Interaction Area at Microsoft Research, where he manages the Computational User Experiences group. He also holds an affiliate faculty appointment in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington. Desney?s research interests include Human-Computer Interaction and Physiological Computing. Desney received his PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked with Randy Pausch. In 2007, he was honored as one of MIT Technology Review's Young Innovators under 35 for his work in brain-computer interfaces. He has also served as the Technical Program Chair at the CHI 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, and will chair the conference in 2011.</p>
